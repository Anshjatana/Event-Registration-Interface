Built an interactive event registration interface using React.js, showcasing a seamless user experience. The registration form encompasses essential fields like Full Name, Email, Contact Number, and a Short Bio, complete with robust form validation ensuring data accuracy.

Once users register, their information seamlessly populates the Registered Users List, displaying their names and timestamps. This list offers a convenient "View Details" option, triggering a user-friendly popup showcasing comprehensive user information.

Leveraged the capabilities of Local Storage to persistently store the registration data. This enables seamless data retrieval and display every time the application state is updated, ensuring a seamless and efficient user journey.

The registration form intelligently adjusts its layout, providing an optimal viewing and interaction experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
